OceanHackWeek analysis of biogeochemical data from multiple sources in the Southern Ocean

Our motivating goals:
*Spatial and temporal alignment of data
*Learning about new-to-us datasets, and combining those with datasets we have previously worked with
*Assimilating BGC data into a common framework (i.e. for assimilation into models)
*Merging biological and physical data
*Some are Southern Ocean people, others interested taking these lessons eventually to other regions

What we hope to accomplish:
1) OOI data: What data streams are there for physical (T, S, meteorology) and biogeochemical parameters (pH, pCO2, oxygen, nitrate, chlorophyll) and when were those sensors working?

2) Argo data: When and where are there Argo float profiles in the viscinity of the OOI array, and what subset have biogeochemical data (SOCCOM floats)?
--> Multiple ways to access Argo data (either full T/S dataset, or just SOCCOM data)

3) Remote sensing: Also bring in regional satellite data for temperature, chlorophyll, SSH, etc.

4) Merge OOI, Argo, and remote sensing data that match in space/time
