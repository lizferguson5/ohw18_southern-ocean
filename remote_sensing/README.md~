# southern-ocean
OceanHackWeek Southern Ocean team!

Our motivating goals:
*Spatial and temporal alignment of data
*Learning about new datasets (some have used Argo, some have used OOI, as well as other things)
*Assimilating BGC data into a common framework (for assimilation into models)
*Merging biological and physical data
*Some are Southern Ocean people, others interested taking these lessons eventually to other regions

What we hope to accomplish:
1) Pulling out OOI data: What data streams are there for pH and pCO2 and when were those sensors working?

2) When and where are there Argo float profiles in the viscinity of the OOI array?
--> How to get Argo data? Coriolis? SOCCOM website? DOI snapshot of entire Argo dataset with text files that show lat-lon timestamp.
--> one outcome of this project could be multiple pathways to access Argo data, in addition to picking correct method for this project

3) Remote sensing: Also bring in regional satellite data for temperature, chlorophyll, SSH, etc.

4) Merge OOI, Argo, and remote sensing data that match in space/time
